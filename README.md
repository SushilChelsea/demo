## REQUIREMENTS

- The application should utilize a mysql database, 
- and you should have vite.js available on the frontend. 
- The app should utilize standard blade files for views.

## Create a Model, Controller and declare properties for Card

Each card should have:
- name,
- date created and modified,
- tags(like keywords, this can be stored as a json array in a column  
- description
And an optional field
- highlighted - which should be a boolean switch, this is later on going to give the card that has it set to true, a halo effect.

## Implement required logic for creating a card, implement the required UI in a blade file

## Implement the required logic for rendering multiple cards in a grid layout

## Implement required logic for editing an existing card, re-use the UI for creating, by populating its fields with the value of the selected card. Utilize AJAX for this

## Implement required logic for deleting an existing card, once the card is deleted, show a temporary toast(2s duration), use AJAX and remove the card.

## Improve on the UX in any way you see fit :)
